## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Choose a good client

To fully experience all the features of MCP, you need a powerful client. We recommend [Cherry Studio](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio), which is both powerful and easy to use.

### Step 2: Configure the MCP server

1. Download and install the client of your choice (such as Cherry Studio).
2. After launching the client, follow the prompts within the software to set it up.
3. Add the MCP server address to the client. Remember to enter the correct server URL: `https://mcp.bupt.site`, so that the connection works properly.

**Tip:** If you encounter any issues or need help during usage, check out the official documentation or contact community support.

Have fun! ðŸ˜„ðŸŒŸ
